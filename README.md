# In-person challenge

Quantum computers have many exciting known uses for understanding our world. But, if the arc of classical computing is any guide, there are many quantum applications yet to discover for creating something wholly new.

For this challenge, you must use a quantum computer to *generate* something new.

Some ideas:
 - Make music with a quantum computer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12408.pdf)
 - Render graphics with a quantum ray tracer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12797.pdf)
 - Use procedural generation to make a new world (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11510)
 - Make a QGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03924)

Once you've debugged your code with regular simulation, please try our noisy simulators before graduating to hardware (if you have time). Hardware noise can have unexpected effects!

We will judge your entry based on both (1) how quantum it is and (2) how cool it is. 

Happy hacking!

## Documentation

This year’s iQuHACK challenges require a write-up/documentation portion that is heavily considered during
judging. The write-up is a chance for you to be creative in describing your approach and describing
your process. It can be in the form of a blog post, a short YouTube video or any form of
social media. It should clearly explain the problem, the approach you used, your implementation with results
from simulation and hardware, and how you accessed the quantum hardware (total number of shots used, 
backends used, etc.).

Make sure to clearly link the documentation into the `README.md` and to include a link to the original challenge 
repository from the documentation!


## Submission

To submit the challenge, do the following:
1. Place all the code you wrote in one folder with your team name under the `team_solutions/` folder (for example `team_solutions/quantum_team`).
2. Create a new entry in `team_solutions.md` following the format shown that links to the folder with your solution and your documentation.
3. Create a Pull Request from your repository to the original challenge repository
4. Submit the "challenge submission" form

Project submission forms will automatically close on Sunday at 10am EST and won't accept late submissions.
