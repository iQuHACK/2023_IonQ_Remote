1. If you're working on qBraid, first fork this repository and click the above `Launch on qBraid` button. It will take you to your qBraid Lab with the repository cloned.
2. Once cloned, open terminal (first icon in the **Other** column in Launcher) and `cd` into this repo. Set the repo's remote origin using the git clone url you copied in Step 1, and then create a new branch for your team:
```bash
cd  <ionq_git_repo_name>
git remote set-url origin <url>
git branch <team_name>
git checkout <team_name>
```

3. Use the environment manager (**ENVS** tab in the right sidebar) to [install environment](https://qbraid-qbraid.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/lab/environments.html#install-environment) "IonQ". The installation should take ~2 min.
4. Once the installation is complete, click **Activate** to [add a new ipykernel](https://qbraid-qbraid.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/lab/kernels.html#add-remove-kernels) for "IonQ".
5. From the **FILES** tab in the left sidebar, double-click on the IonQ repository directory.
6. Open and follow instructions in [`verify_setup.ipynb`](verify_setup.ipynb) to verify your "IonQ" environment setup.
7. You are now ready to begin hacking! Work with your team to complete the challenges.
